"""Every menu screen in each input's variant, as one HTML contact sheet, with
the screens' layout checked from the game's own geometry.

    python tools/menu_gallery.py --check                # the layout checks alone, in seconds (CI's)
    python tools/menu_gallery.py                        # build/menu_gallery/index.html
    python tools/menu_gallery.py --regenerate --screens audio_settings   # a generator's change, seen
    python tools/menu_gallery.py --compare master       # only the screens that differ
    python tools/menu_gallery.py --remote 5900x.fabric  # on a Linux box over ssh

The screens are enumerated from the generated menu files
(port/assets/menus/ce: the root, every screen an event opens, and every
widget named *_screen that no other holds; VR's settings, drawn in the
headset, with --vr). One run of the game walks a variant's screens
(debug.menu_tour: each opened alone, its layout written by debug.menu_layout's
code, port/linux/game/menu_layout.c, and its frame saved), hidden and muted,
in folders of its own (its HOME, its data root with the maps linked in), off
the network and the clipboard; a variant's screens are split over as many
runs as --jobs allows, all at once. The variants are the maintainer's
priorities: keyboard and mouse at 16:9, a controller at 16:10 (the Steam
Deck's 1280x800) and touch on a phone in landscape (2400x1080); --variants
all adds 4:3 and 21:9.

No build is needed for a change to the menu files: the runs read this tree's
port/assets/menus over the build's own (the menus folder beside config.toml,
menu_files.c), so a generator's change (--regenerate runs
tools/port_settings.py first; tools/ce_menus.py needs the PC version's tags)
is seen in seconds. --build-menus uses the build's own.

--check draws no pictures (debug.null_renderer): the layout checks for every
screen and variant in a few seconds, the mode for after each regenerate and
for CI.

--compare <git ref or build folder> renders the screens with that too and
shows only the screens that changed, before | after, with a count of the
rest. A ref that differs from this tree only in its menu files (and tools and
documents) is drawn by this build with its files (git's archive of them);
another is checked out in build/menu_gallery_trees/<commit> and built, the
build's configure_args reused.

The layout checks (each screen in each variant): text cut by its clip or
past its box's foot, text over another's, anything off the screen, a phone's
safe areas (an iPhone's in landscape, scaled), touch targets under about 7 mm
on the phone, and prompts with the other input's glyphs. They are in the page
and in report.json, and the exit status is 1 where there is one (with
--compare, one the before has not; without, the touch targets are reported
but do not fail it, since the touch layout's rows are 3 to 5 mm on every
screen). A screen that writes no layout (it closes at once without a state
the run has not, or it is the virtual keyboard's) is marked so.

The pictures are the game's imagery: they stay in --out (under build/, which
git ignores), never committed nor pushed.

--remote <host> runs it on a Linux box: this commit is pushed to the clone
there (--remote-tree; made from ~/openh1-vulkan-check's when missing), the
uncommitted changes applied, build/linux_x86_64 built, and the gallery made
there with --remote-data's maps; the folder comes back as a tar into --out.
