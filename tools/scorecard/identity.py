"""The hard gate (README.md): at 30 Hz a branch plays exactly as master does, tick for tick. StageKit's scenarios
are played at 30 Hz with the determinism log (debug.determinism_log), by this build and by master's, and the logs
compared (tools/determinism_compare.py: each tick's game state, allocation by allocation, and random seeds, the
seeds' takers by count, as two builds' call sites lie at other addresses; COMPARE).

    python tools/scorecard/identity.py --baseline-game <master's build>/halo
    python tools/scorecard/identity.py --record <folder>      this build's logs, as master's baseline
    python tools/scorecard/identity.py --baseline <folder>    this build against logs recorded so
    python tools/scorecard/identity.py --repeat               this build against itself: two runs of the same input
    python tools/scorecard/identity.py --repeat --mutation unseeded   a draw by the host's clock: must fail

The scenarios use only what master's game has had since the merge of OpenCE's StageKit (the scripted bot,
debug.test_input "bot:", on the game's clock; cues; debug.fixed_step), so that either build plays them; the maps
are this build's generator's, the same for both.

--repeat is the determinism check: the same build, input, seed and settings played twice must log the same game
state, seeds and seeds' takers (by call site, the same build's) every tick, and the same frames' state too
(REPEAT_COMPARE). It needs no baseline, so CI runs it on every branch, with its negative control.

Exit status: 0 when every scenario's logs agree, 1 when one parts (the first tick where, and what), 2 when the gate
could not run (no baseline: a note, not a failure, with --missing-ok).
