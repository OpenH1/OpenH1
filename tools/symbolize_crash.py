"""Puts function names and source lines on a crash's frames:

    python tools/symbolize_crash.py <report> <build>

The report is a crash report's zip (Report a Problem's, with crash.txt and
report.md), its crash.txt, or a log with the crash's lines in it (halo.log,
debug.txt, the console's copy). The build is the one that crashed: its
folder, or its files, as --guest and --host name them.

The macOS, iOS, Linux and Android builds' crash lines
(port/android/host/host_memory_watch.c) give each address as the host saw
it. The guest's are its 32-bit addresses; with the base register (the macOS
and iOS builds, configure.py --guest-base) the host's addresses of the
guest are the base ("guest memory at") plus them, without it (the x32 guest
of 64-bit x86 Linux, Android's) they are the guest's own. These are looked
up in the guest image, halo_guest.debug.elf (the image with its source
lines, beside build/<platform>/halo; the builds carry halo_guest.elf, the
same image stripped of them, which names the functions only), and the
host's (the "host image at" line places it) in the host's executable (the
macOS executable through atos, which reads its debugging information where
the build left it; the others' through llvm-symbolizer). Without an image
file the guest image the executable carries is used (the macOS app's
Contents/MacOS/halo, the Linux release's lib/openh1/halo, the APK's
assets/halo_guest.elf). The game's reference address (debug.txt's, which
report.md repeats: write_to_error_file's address) must be the image's, or
the image is another build's and the tool stops.

A release's build has its halo_guest.debug.elf in the release, beside it:
OpenH1-<machine>[-debug]-symbols.zip (OpenH1-macOS-symbols.zip,
OpenH1-Linux-symbols.zip, OpenH1-Linux-ARM64-debug-symbols.zip,
OpenH1-Android-symbols.zip...: tools/release_names.py), in the release the
report's Build line names (build-<n>, its flavour release or debug; the
releases keep the last five builds). Give the zip as it is downloaded, with
the player's download if the host's frames are wanted too:

    python tools/symbolize_crash.py report.zip OpenH1-Linux-symbols.zip OpenH1-Linux.zip

When the report names a release's build and the image is not that build's,
or has no source lines, the tool says which zip to fetch.

The Windows build's crash lines (port/windows/host/host_memory_watch_win.c)
name each frame's module and the offset in it: its build is the folder of
halo.exe with its halo.pdb and halo_guest.debug.elf, or a release's
OpenH1-Windows[-debug]-symbols.zip (halo.pdb and halo_guest.debug.elf)
with the zip of the same name without -symbols (halo.exe). The crash reports that
reach Sentry need none of this for the host's frames: Sentry symbolizes
them itself.

llvm-symbolizer is the guests' pinned LLVM's (python tools/guest_toolchain.py
fetches it and prints its bin/), or the PATH's, or --symbolizer's.
