"""The menu engine's parity with the game's widgets (docs/menu_engine.md), proved by machine: every generated
screen run on each engine (display.menu_engine "classic" and "new"), in each aspect ratio and with each input,
and what each draws compared.

    python tools/menu_parity.py --layout              # every screen's debug.menu_layout, both engines, diffed
    python tools/menu_parity.py --layout --screens settings --variants 16x9-keyboard
    python tools/menu_parity.py --behaviour --sweep   # the scripts of presses, and every screen's navigation
    python tools/menu_parity.py --search              # Settings' search's scripts, on the new engine alone

--layout runs tools/menu_gallery.py's tour (debug.menu_tour: each screen opened alone, hidden, muted, no renderer,
from the player profile the behaviour scripts start from, the game's functions that open it run first:
menu_gallery.TOUR_SETUP) once on each engine for each variant, and compares each screen's layout
(port/linux/game/menu_layout.c: every widget's box and clip, every string's text, box, clip and extent, every
button's glyph and every pointer target), item by item. A screen with no layout on either side (it closed at once,
or another was drawn) is not the same but NOT COMPARED, which fails it, but for the name screens the game shows
only under the virtual keyboard (menu_gallery.UNDER_KEYBOARD), whose frames --pixels compares. The variants are the
four aspect ratios (4:3, 16:10, 16:9, 21:9) with each input (a controller, the keyboard and mouse, touch).

--behaviour runs scripts of presses (debug.test_input "menu:ready ...", SCRIPTS) on each engine from the same
config.toml and player profile and compares where the focus was after each press, config.toml, the profile's files,
the settings written and the last screen's layout; --sweep adds every generated screen's navigation (SWEEP).

The new engine draws each widget of the generated screens from its look in the model (model/look:
tools/menu_look.py), never its widget definition; a widget it draws from its definition is logged ("menu engine:
look from the widget definition"), which fails it too. --look-control proves that this is noticed: a model with a
widget's look taken out must log it.

The runs reuse one map cache (a clone of --saves's, by default ~/.cache/openh1-bench/saves/z: APFS clones on a
Mac, so nothing is unpacked again), each with its own data and save folders, deleted afterwards. A difference
not listed in DELIBERATE fails it (exit status 1). A screen a hand-written one replaces on the new engine
(HAND_WRITTEN: docs/menu_screens.md) is not compared, but each side must have drawn its own.
