# The macOS app's update key (port/macos/README.md, "Updates"): the EdDSA
# key pair Sparkle checks each update with.
#
#   1. makes the key pair with Sparkle's generate_keys, its private half in
#      this Mac's login Keychain (account "openh1"), or finds the one there
#   2. sets the repository secret SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY on OpenH1/OpenH1, with
#      which CI signs each release's OpenH1.dmg for the appcast
#   3. sets the repository variable SPARKLE_PUBLIC_KEY, which CI puts in the
#      release app's Info.plist (SUPublicEDKey), and prints it
#
# Nothing secret is printed or kept outside the Keychain: the exported key
# lives in a private temporary folder that is deleted on exit. Run it again
# on the same Mac and it sets the same key. Keep the Keychain's entry (or a
# backup of it: generate_keys -x): the apps already out accept only updates
# signed with it.
#
#   bash tools/setup_sparkle_key.sh [--force]
#
# --force sets a new key though the repository has one and this Mac's
# Keychain does not: the apps already out will then refuse the updates
# until they are updated by hand.
