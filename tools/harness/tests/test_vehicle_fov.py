"""display.vehicle_fov (view_fov.c's render_fov_vertical, render_fov_reticle_scale): a seat's view, first or third
person, and the moments of entering and leaving it take the vehicle's field of view ("default": the game's own, its
reticle at the stock size; "match": display.fov's; a number: its angle), on foot display.fov's. Getting in and out the
view eases between them, and each frame's reticle is scaled from that frame's view (the Shade's turret, #441); death,
the director's neutral view, a scripted camera and a scope's full zoom keep the game's."""
