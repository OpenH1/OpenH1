"""display.vehicle_fov (view_fov.c's render_fov_vertical, render_fov_reticle_scale): a third-person seat's view (a
driver's, a gunner's, display.passenger_third_person's passenger) and the moments of entering and leaving it take the
vehicle's field of view ("default": the game's own, its reticle at the stock size; "match": display.fov's; a number:
its angle); on foot and in a first-person seat (a passenger's, the Shade's turret: #775) display.fov's. Getting in and
out, and from one kind of seat to the other, the view eases between them, and each frame's reticle is scaled from that
frame's view (#441); each local player has their own; death, the director's neutral view, a scripted camera and a
scope's full zoom keep the game's."""
