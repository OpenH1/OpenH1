"""The first-person weapon's near clip plane (port/linux/game/near_clip.c's render_first_person_near_clip_distance):
the game's own at the weapon's stock angle and place, so the default is drawn as ever; nearer where its projection is
widened (display.viewmodel_fov, display.panini's magnification), its farthest corner as far from the eye as the stock
angle's, so the weapon's rear brought onto the screen at a wide view is not cut (#604); nearer by as much where the
weapon is moved toward the eye (display.viewmodel_offset_z). And where it is wired: every pass that draws the weapon,
the weapon's move recorded, not the VR mode's."""
