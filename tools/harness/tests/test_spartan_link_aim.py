"""The Spartan link's reticle on a teammate's feed (port/linux/game/spartan_link.c): where their aim lands on the feed
through its camera, whether it is red (a living enemy biped in their weapon's autoaim reach, as Halo's reticle), and
the line along the aim (past their own unit and what it rides; a collision test only). And where it is drawn: on the
link's feeds alone, after the link's own check that it is shown."""
