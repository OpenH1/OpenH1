"""The frames between the ticks at 60 and 120 Hz (port/linux/game/render_interpolation.c, on sim_rate.c's
sim_substep_blend): an object of the micro lane, and the first-person view of a player's biped, are drawn between
the poses its sub-steps left (a frame in sub-step j of the tick drawn: between the end of j - 1, or of the tick
before, and the end of j), what it carries with it; at 30 the frames are the line between the ticks' snapshots, as
they were. A projectile is drawn from its newest sub-steps: its head start and hold from half a tick's motion back,
turning between its sub-steps' rotations as it moves between their places, and the VR mode's grenade let go of in a sub-step from the hand, with no dart and no pop. In a network game another machine's
player is drawn between its two newest sub-steps (the open tick's), not a tick behind, gliding to the tick drawn's
path and back when that is let go of and taken again; at 30 it is drawn as before."""
