"""The frames between the ticks at 60 and 120 Hz for a vehicle a player drives (port/linux/game/render_interpolation.c):
it moves and turns in the sub-steps (vehicles.c), and is drawn between the frames (its root node's place and
rotation) its sub-steps left, the rotation nlerped the shorter way; its nodes, and those of what it carries (its
rider, its turret's gun), blended between the ticks in its frame and placed where the sub-steps' frame has it. The
view from its seat, in the first person or following it, hangs on it at the unit's camera position: taken back to
where the tick left that point (a frame slower than a sub-step has the next tick's first in the observer), and moved
with it onto the vehicle's path. At 30, and for a vehicle of the macro lane, the frames are the line between the
ticks' snapshots, as they were."""
