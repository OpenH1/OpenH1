"""The lobby's Start and the new menus' Add Player (port/linux/game/menu_functions.c's pc_menu_lobby_start,
lobby_join_start and add_player_*, lobby_menu.inc's lobby_board_start; issues 1066 and 1067), the real code against
a fake world (add_player.c): another controller's Start joins it on Add Player and never starts the host's game,
which the host's Start still does; on Add Player each controller not in the game joins, chooses its own profile and is
ready with its own keys, which are never the screen's, and all of them are brought in on their profiles once every one
is ready. Each check has a fault that it must catch."""
