"""The menus' hand-written screens (port/linux/src/menu_screens.c, docs/menu_screens.md): the real main menu's file
read into its building blocks; files with problems (bad XML, an element or attribute it may not have, an item with
no label or action, a focus or a when that names nothing, an action or binding the game has not got) refused with
their file and line, the screen read before kept and the problem logged; a file read again taking its screen's place;
bindings filled, and a line whose binding has no value not complete; an item's when. The actions and bindings are the
game's own tables (port/linux/game/menu_screen.c), and every action the game names is one it runs."""
