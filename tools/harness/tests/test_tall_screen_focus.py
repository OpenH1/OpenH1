"""Every widget of a tall screen (menu_screen_tall.inc) that does something when A, a click or a tap is on it is one
the D-pad and the stick reach, and A presses (issue 1065): the engine steps the focus through the screen's body (its
children, up and down) and through the lists in it (a bar's buttons, the tabs, the titles: left and right), so each
such widget must be in the body, or in a list stepped through its items that is (blocks.xml's *_tabs_* flags), and its
block must have an A handler. The server browser's HOST & MORE, in a bar of its own on the screen itself, out of the
body, took its key, a click and a tap but never the D-pad's focus, so a controller could not select it."""
