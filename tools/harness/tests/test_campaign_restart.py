"""A campaign mission in progress started again (#680; port/linux/game/campaign_menu.inc's campaign_restart_*,
menu_functions.c's campaign_start and campaign_continue, game_state.c's game_state_save_to_persistent_storage): RESTART
offered with a saved game, on the Campaign menu and on its mission's card in Choose Mission; the question's RESTART
plays the mission from its start at the saved game's difficulty, without loading it; CANCEL changes nothing; the saved
game's file is kept until the new start's first checkpoint. And the screens: RESTART MISSION under CONTINUE, RESTART
in Choose Mission's footer apart from its other prompts, the question laid out as the other boxes are."""
