"""The game state's image (source/saved games/game_state.c): a checkpoint's holds the part of the game state in use, the
CPU's allocations then the GPU's; taken back, from it or from an image of the whole game state (an older build's file,
a core, Save and Quit's), the parts in use are what they were and the rest is left; what is checked is found at the
same place in both; an image of another size is refused (#644)."""
