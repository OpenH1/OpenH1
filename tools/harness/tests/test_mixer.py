"""The real mixer of dsound_sdl.c on known signals (mixer.c): its resampler against the same low pass worked out in
double precision, sines through it as the ear hears them, voices out of earshot, mono voices, the linear
resampler, the Xbox ADPCM decoder against reference vectors, the Doppler shift, the limiter, audio.channels' choice
and the 5.1 pan, the LFE's low pass, and 3D audio: audio.spatial's choice, the HRTF's cues against the pan's, its
distance, occlusion, reverb and Doppler, the crossfade when the choice changes, and 2D voices left as they are; the master
volume on every kind of voice; and the
hand-off of the game's side of the voices to the mixer, which never waits for a game thread.
