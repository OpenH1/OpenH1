"""The HUD's marks over the world drawn where their points project through the frame's view: a waypoint and the
distance under it (a scenario's flag or object, a game engine goal, Basic Training's spots: hud_nav_points.c), a
teammate's triangle and a player's name (hud.c) and the passenger's reticle (passenger_camera.c). The game places
them in whole units of its 480-line screen, three to four of a 1080p or a laptop's display's pixels: a mark stepped a
unit at a time, short of its point by up to a unit, while the world under it moved smoothly, so it jittered against
the world as the view turned or moved. They are placed where the point projects, the part past the whole units drawn
as an offset of the screen quads and the text (rasterizer.c's rasterizer_screen_offset_set) for that mark alone. The
number under a waypoint is the meters to the nearest tenth: it took the whole meters rounded to the nearest and the
tenth cut short, 108.6 m shown as 109.6."""
