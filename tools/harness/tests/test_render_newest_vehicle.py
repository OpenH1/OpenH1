"""The view from a local player's vehicle drawn from its newest step (port/linux/game/render_interpolation.c,
display.direct_camera): the vehicle, and what it carries, drawn where its newest step left it, carried on by its
velocity and its spin for the time since (less than none past a macro lane vehicle's first sub-step at 60 and 120),
its pose blended between the ticks in its frame; the view from its seat at the seat's camera point there, aimed where
the player aims (in the first person turned to the vehicle's up and rolled with it, as the first-person camera poses
it; following it, the player's aim), turned on by the aim's motion come since the frame's input, read once a frame. A
step that the motion carried on did not foresee (a climb begun at once) is blended in from where the vehicle was
drawn, never jumped to, but a start from standing is drawn at once; the view's pitch held at the seat's easing limit
moves evenly. A correction glides the vehicle and the view the same; getting in or out (dying, respawning in it)
glides the vehicle from one drawing to the other. Off (display.direct_camera false), or a seat whose view is the
gun's, it is drawn between the ticks as before."""
