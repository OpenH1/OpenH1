"""The high-res text's letter spacing (issues 744 and 754): a run of text (a line's characters up to a tab, an icon or
a change of style: draw_string.c's draw_string_port_run) set with the font's own advances and kerning, every letter as much closer
or further apart, its ink where the font tag's ink is (rasterizer_text.c's hires_text_run_lay_out), for the game's
unicode strings and its byte strings; a run the font cannot draw all of centred glyph by glyph, as before.
tools/test_text_spacing.py measures every string of the menus and the maps the same way (it needs the maps)."""
