/*
CAMPAIGN_RESTART.C (test)

A mission in progress started again (port/linux/game/campaign_menu.inc's
campaign_restart_*, menu_functions.c's campaign_start and
campaign_continue, game_state.c's game_state_save_to_persistent_storage):
RESTART offered with a saved game (the Campaign menu's, its mission's card
on Choose Mission), its question's RESTART playing the mission from its
start at the saved game's difficulty, CANCEL changing nothing, and the
saved game's file kept until the new start's first checkpoint.
test_campaign_restart.py takes the code (under_test.inc).

The world: the profile's saved game on disk (its mission, difficulty and
which play wrote it), main.c's map change (main_set_map_name allows the
saved game, main_disallow_persistent_storage does not; main_new_map loads
it if allowed and of the difficulty played, as
game_state_try_and_load_from_persistent_storage does), and the game's
checkpoint in memory.
