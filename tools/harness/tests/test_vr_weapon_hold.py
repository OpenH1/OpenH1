"""The VR mode's first-person weapon held in the hand (port/linux/game/vr_hands.c's weapon_hold, weapon_root_find and
support_hold, with source/math/matrix_math.c): the game's animations swing the whole weapon and both arms about the
camera (the plasma pistol's charged shot, a vent, a melee, a reload), which on the flat screen reads as recoil and in
the hand flings the weapon out of it; in VR the weapon's root is held where the idle pose has it from the camera (in
the controller, the shots' own kick in the camera), everything moved with it rigidly, so that what moves within the
weapon (a slide) still does. The root is the gun node the weapon's parts hang from, not a part hanging apart nor the
graph's root; the left hand on a long gun's foregrip follows the animation's hand near the grip (a pump) and stays on
the weapon, in the idle pose's grip, as the animation takes it away. No VR runtime: a fake graph and poses."""
