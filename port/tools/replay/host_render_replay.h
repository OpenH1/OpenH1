/*
HOST_RENDER_REPLAY.H

The renderer's command stream replayed from a recording (HALO_RENDER_RECORD:
port/android/host/host_render_record.h), without the game: no guest, no
maps. What the replays share (host_render_replay.c): the recording read (its
blocks LZ4's as Apple's libcompression writes them, or stored), the guest's
memory put back before each record, the guest's side of the ring, the
frames measured, the frames' pictures compared, and the service
(--serve) a client drives (docs/replay_protocol.md). Each replay is a backend's: Metal's
(port/macos/tools/halo_replay.m), Vulkan's (port/linux/vulkan/tools/
halo_replay.c), which hands host_render_replay_main its platform.

halo_replay <file> [--frames a-b] [--window] [--unpaced] [--shots dir]
	[--shot-frames list] [--loop N] [--hitch ms] [--quiet] [--verbose]
halo_replay <file> --serve
halo_replay --compare <shots> <shots>

--frames a-b: the frames measured (those before are played unmeasured, the
stream's state being theirs; none after); --window: in a window (Metal's),
paced by the display unless --unpaced (offscreen, the frames are as fast as
the GPU); --shots dir: the back buffers of the frames of --shot-frames (as
HALO_RENDER_SHOT_FRAMES; all measured frames if not given) as PNGs, in
dir/loop<n> with --loop; --loop N: the whole replayed N times in one
process; --hitch ms: a hitch is an interval over this (default 12.5: 1.5
refreshes at 120 Hz) and twice the median. --compare a b: the PNGs of two
shot folders compared, pixel by pixel.

Prints each measured frame: its interval (the render thread's, from frame
end to frame end), the render thread's CPU time, the GPU time of the command
buffers completed in it (a frame or two late), its draws and the pipelines
made (compiles) in it; then a summary, hitches named.

--serve: requests as JSON lines on standard input, one JSON line answering
each on standard output (the log on standard error):

	{"cmd":"info"}  ("protocol": HOST_RENDER_REPLAY_PROTOCOL)
	{"cmd":"frame","n":N,"png":"<path>","ids":"<path>"}  (or "inline":true)
	{"cmd":"draws","n":N}
	{"cmd":"pick","n":N,"x":X,"y":Y}
	{"cmd":"thumbs","every":E,"width":W,"dir":"<folder>"}  (or "frames":[..],
		"inline":true)
	{"cmd":"cost","n":N,"repeats":R,"draws":[..]}  (or "all":true, "top":K)

cost: frame N's GPU time, the frame's and its passes' (the backend's
timestamps at their boundaries) and its draws' (the frame played again with
each left out: what the frame takes without it, subtracted from what it
takes whole; or the backend's timestamps around each draw, where it has
them), each the median of R plays with its spread. The frame is played
again where it is, after itself (not from the recording's start): the
frame played after a cost is played from the start again, exactly.

A frame is played exactly: the frames before it are played first (from the
recording's start again for one before the frame last played; those more
than eight before it without the GPU's work of their draws, clears,
anti-aliasing, tone map and present, which nothing reads), and its picture
is the back buffer it presents, read before it is presented. Its
ID buffer (where the backend has one) gives each pixel the draws that
changed it, topmost first: a draw's number in its frame plus one (0: none),
a draw being a DRAW, DRAW_INDICES, DRAW_INDEXED or DRAW_IMMEDIATE record of
the frame, counted from its first. A draw counts where it changed the
pixel's value (an alpha-tested leaf's quad, not its cut-out corners).

A recording made with debug.render_marks (the stream's MARK records) says
what each draw belongs to: draws and pick give each draw's owner (its
"kind", "label", "id", "tags": object, model, shader, bitmap; a menu
widget's "widget" tag and "source", the generator's file and the source
attribute's text) and the game renderer's "category" it was drawn in; the
frame's view (its "map", "tick", "window", "camera": position, forward,
up, fov in radians; "viewport" in the back buffer's pixels; every view of
the frame in "views"). Without them a draw's kind is "other" and its label
its record's kind and primitive.
