/*
HOST_RENDER_RECORD.H

The renderer's command stream recorded to a file, and the frames' pictures
taken, as the render thread plays them (host_render_record.c): the fast
loop of the renderer's work, which a tool replays without the game
(port/macos/tools/halo_replay.m).

HALO_RENDER_RECORD=<file> records every record the decoder plays, in its
order, with the guest memory each one reads through guest addresses: the
inline data too large for the ring (in a buffer of its own), and what the
backend reads in place, which it names (host_render_record_note: the Xbox
textures' headers, palettes and texels, the high-res images' pixels) as it
reads it. Memory is stored by its content's hash, each content once.

HALO_RENDER_SHOTS=<directory> and HALO_RENDER_SHOT_FRAMES=<frames> (a list:
"300,600", "100-900/100") write the back buffer of those frames as the
frame presents it, read from the backend (host_render_record_set_shooter),
to <directory>/frame_<n>.png; a frame is counted from the stream's start
(the first is 0). The replay writes the same frames' the same way.

The file's format is this file's and the replay's alone (versioned:
HOST_RENDER_RECORD_VERSION); the stream's own is unchanged.
