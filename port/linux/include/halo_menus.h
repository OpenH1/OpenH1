/*
HALO_MENUS.H

The menus written in XML (port/assets/menus, and a menus folder beside
config.toml), as the platform layer reads them (port/linux/src/menu_files.c)
for the game, which builds them into widget tags when ui.map loads
(port/linux/game/menu_tags.c). Plain C89 types, for both: each element keeps
its attributes as written, and the file and line it came from; the game reads
their meaning.

A file holds <menus> with <bitmap> (holding <frame>s), <strings> (holding
<string>s) and <widget> elements; a <widget> holds <widget> and <child>
(its children), <on> (an event handler), <data> (a game data input),
<conditional> and <replace> elements. port/assets/menus/README.md describes
them.
