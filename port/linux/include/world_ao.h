/*
WORLD_AO.H

display.ambient_occlusion "world" (docs/world-ao.md, #578): ambient
occlusion found in world space, from the structure's baked distance field
(world_sdf.h) and the objects' analytic proxies (world_proxies.h), applied
to the ambient term alone in the shaders (xgpu.h's
XGPU_AMBIENT_OCCLUSION_LIGHT_*). Render-only and deterministic: no noise, no
history, nothing from the screen. Off ("off", and Classic's preset, which
sets "off") draws exactly as before.

The renderer's side of a frame (this file's game hooks, called from
source/render/render.c), and the front end's (halo_world_ao_*,
port/linux/src/d3d8_device.c, which hands it to the backend:
xgpu_backend_world_ao_*). Workstream D owns the shading and this file's
setting; A, B and C fill what it hands on.
