/*
MENU_SCREENS.H

The menus' hand-written screens (port/assets/menus/screens,
docs/menu_screens.md): one file a screen, its building blocks and what each
does, read by the platform layer (port/linux/src/menu_screens.c) and made
into widgets by the menu engine (port/linux/game/menu_screen.c). Plain C89
types, for both.

A screen file holds <screen> (name, back), and in it, from the top of the
screen down: <title-art/>, <header> (title, picture, detail, a <button>),
<list> (focus) holding <item>s (id, label, hint or <hint>s, do, when),
<cards> holding <card>s, <tabs> (current) holding <tab>s, <table> (source,
sorted, do, empty, lanes, left, right) holding <lane>s, <column>s (each a <search> in its title) and a
<button>, <search>, <panel>s (each its if) holding <heading>, <text>, <pills> of <pill>s,
<pair>, <choice>, <picture>, <spartan> and <button>s, <chat> (source, lines, do, if), <space/>, <box> (x, y, width, align) holding a
<list> and a <legend> (x), <objectives> (title), and <buttons> holding
<button>s (key, label, do, width, if). Texts may hold bindings, {name}, filled from C; a do and the
screen's back are actions, a table's source a row source, an if, a current,
a sorted and a search's value bindings: names the game knows. All are
checked as the file is read against the names the game gave
(menu_screens_names).
