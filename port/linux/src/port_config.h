/*
PORT_CONFIG.H

The native ports' settings, read from config.toml (port_config.c): next to
the executable on the desktop, in the data folder (the one holding maps/)
on Android. A missing file is written with every setting commented out at
its default ("# vsync = true": a newer version's default reaches it), as
are a newer version's settings in an older file. Each setting can
also be set for one run with its HALO_* environment variable, which wins
over the file (the tools and the Android app pass settings that way).

Settings are named "section.key", as in the file: "display.vsync".
