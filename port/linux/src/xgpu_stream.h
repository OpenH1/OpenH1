/*
XGPU_STREAM.H

The renderer's command stream: a frame's backend calls (xgpu_backend.h)
written by the game as plain data into a ring in its own memory, and
played back by a backend on the 64-bit host, on a thread of its own, while
the game goes on to the next frame. On the Linux arm64 build, Android and
macOS the game is ILP32 guest code: one host call a frame hands the frame
over instead of a crossing for each GL call, the backend's driver work
leaves the game's thread, and in the VR mode the host can take the newest
head pose just before it submits.

Both sides include this file, so it holds only fixed-width integers and
floats, laid out alike by the guest's ILP32 compiler and the host's LP64
one: every field is 4 bytes or smaller and aligned to its size, every
record a multiple of 4 bytes (the sizes are checked at the end). The
interface's own structures cannot cross as they are: unsigned long and
DWORD are 4 bytes in the guest and 8 on the host.

The guest writes (xgpu_stream_encode.c), the host reads
(port/android/host/host_render_stream.c, which calls the backend's
functions: host_render_stream.h). Guest data is a guest address: the
host's view of it is host_address(address) (port/android/host/host.h). Data
the game rewrites while the frame waits (streamed vertices, indices,
immediate mode, constants, uniforms, mirror writes, the lights) is copied
into the ring after its record ("inline": its address is in the ring);
what is too large for the ring (more than an eighth of it) is copied into
a buffer of its own in guest memory, which the guest frees once the host
has released the record. Textures and palettes are read where they are, as
the Xbox's GPU reads them; their changes are the write tracking's
(memory_watch.c). Refer to "The renderer's command stream" in
port/linux/README.md.

The backend composes each frame (the eyes' images, the HUD's and its

OpenXR's calls that use the device (the session made, the swapchains'
images acquired and released, the frame begun and ended) are made there
(port/linux/host/host_vr_stream.c); the game waits for the runtime's frames and
locates the views (vr.c). What the composition reads of the game's VR mode
(vr.h's and vr_visor.h's functions the guest's backend calls) comes in the
records: VR_STATE before each VR_COMPOSE, the gaze with VR_EYES, the layers
the game would submit with VR_SUBMIT; and what vr.c sets in the backend as
it draws (the eyes' transforms and corrections, the sky's depth clamping, the
feed and the tint) as records of their own, in their order. vr.h's and
