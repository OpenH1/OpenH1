/*
D3D8_DEVICE.C

The Xbox Direct3D 8 device: the renderer's front end.

The game drives the device through the XDK's inline functions, which keep
the "simple" render states in D3D__RenderState and call into this file for
everything else. At each draw the full state is read back from there and
described to the backend (xgpu_backend.h) in no API's terms: the vertex
program decoded once per shader (nv2a_vsh.c), the pixel shader - texture
stages and register combiners, 57 render states - a key the backend
decodes and builds a shader from (nv2a_psh.c), the rest a pipeline key and
dynamic state, the resources the draw reads and its range. What the game's
states mean is known here and nowhere else; how a GPU draws it is the
backend's (Vulkan's or Metal's, in the host, through the command stream:
xgpu_stream_encode.c).

Conventions carried over from the Xbox:
- Clip space is D3D's (depth 0..1, y down in window space): viewports,
  scissors and texture rows are given from the top-left, as D3D has them.
- Render targets and textures are identified by the physical address in
  their Data field. A texture whose data is a render target samples the
  render target directly (render-to-texture).
- Vertex data is read from guest memory at draw time.

/* ---------- the screen's width

The Xbox screen is 640x480. The ports keep its 480 logical lines and widen
the layout to the drawable's shape. On the desktop, display.resolution can
choose another resolution, and display.resolution_scaling "original" keeps
640 columns. Android uses the actual drawable's pixels.
The game's camera derives its horizontal field of view from the viewport, so
the 3D view simply widens. The menus and full-screen overlays are laid out
for 640 columns; while they draw (halo_screen_ui_offset), everything shifts
right to center them.

The renderer draws at that resolution (platform_screen_mode): render
targets the size of the screen get that many pixels (screen_scale), and
viewports, clears and visibility counts are scaled to match, so the game
still works in its 480 lines; "original" draws 640x480, scaled up at
presentation. The width and the scale change only between frames, after one
is presented (halo_screen_commit). */

Vertex and index buffers live in the Xbox's contiguous memory, where most
never change once loaded. The mirror keeps a copy of that memory in the
backend's buffers (one per segment, made when first needed) and uploads a page
only when it is first drawn from or after the game has written it: pages
are write-protected once uploaded, as cached textures are (memory_watch.c).
Pages the game rewrites frame after frame (dynamic vertices) would fault on
every write; after a few such rewrites a page counts as volatile for a
while, and draws that use it stream their data as before. */

/* ---------- a map's preparation's journal (port/linux/game/render_prepared.c)

What a map's preparation (render_enumerate.c: its first frame drawn through
every shader) gives the backend, kept so that a later load of the map gives
it the same without the walk: each draw that was not a repeat
(preparation_seen), as the state it was drawn in (the render and texture
states, the textures, targets, viewport, vertex shader and streams, and the
front end's own that prepare_draw reads); each operation of a window that a
backend prepares something for (a clear, the anti-aliasing, Panini, the
tone map, the glows); each texture the cache loaded
for them, in order; and the mirror's pages uploaded. Played back, each draw
is made again in its state from a vertex or a few (a backend prepares its
pipeline and binds its textures; it draws nothing), each operation again,
each texture loaded and each page uploaded, so that a backend, Vulkan's or
Metal's, is given what the walk gave it; the front end derives the draws'
pipelines again, from the settings as they are now. Objects are kept as what
they are, not where: a cached bitmap by its tag and index (the texture
cache's), a texture, surface or palette the device made by the number of
its making (checked by its type and format), the device's own targets by
name, a vertex shader by its id.

The words: an entry's first, its type in the low 8 bits and in the high 24
the count of its state's words that differ from the entry's before, a pair
(the word's index, its value) each after it; a texture's, JOURNAL_TEXTURE,
then its tag's index and the bitmap's; the pages', JOURNAL_PAGES and the
count of runs, then each run's first unit and the unit past it. A unit is
JOURNAL_PAGE_UNIT's bytes of the contiguous window, whatever the platform's
mirror page (MIRROR_PAGE_SIZE: the host's, 4 KB or larger),
