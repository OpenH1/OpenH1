/*
XBOX_TEXTURES.C

The high-res replacements drawn in place of the Xbox's textures, and the
Custom Edition channel orders; the host caches the textures themselves
(port/linux/vulkan/xgpu_vulkan_textures.c, port/macos/xgpu_metal_textures.c),
decoded by xbox_texture_decode.c.

An Xbox texture is a Direct3D header - Common, Data (physical address),
Lock, Format and Size - over texels in guest memory. Power-of-two textures
are swizzled (Morton order, one level after another); textures with a Size
field are linear, with a pitch, and are addressed with texel coordinates.
DXT textures are stored as plain 4x4 blocks. Everything except DXT is
converted to 32-bit BGRA on upload.

A cached texture stays valid until any page it was read from is written;
memory_watch.c detects that by write-protecting the pages.

Here are the replacements, as images (xgpu_images.h), and the Custom
Edition channel orders, which the command stream hands the host.

/* ---------- Custom Edition channel orders

Halo PC keeps what some textures hold in other channels than the game reads
it from (enum custom_edition_channel_order): a model shader's multipurpose
masks, and a HUD meter's shape and fill order. The Custom Edition map
loading says which texels hold which order as they arrive
(port/linux/game/custom_edition_bitmaps.c), and textures made of them are
sampled with each channel taken from where Halo PC keeps it, which leaves
them as compressed as they were. Addresses stay listed until other texels
arrive there, which the loading also says, or the map goes; the game and the
renderer share a thread. */
