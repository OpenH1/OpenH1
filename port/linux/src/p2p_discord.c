/*
P2P_DISCORD.C

Discord's rich presence, invites and asks to join (p2p.c), through the
Discord desktop client's local RPC socket (a Unix socket, or a named pipe on
Windows; debug.discord_socket names a test's stand-in).

What the activity shows (discord.rich_presence; nothing while it is off):
- the menus: "In the menus", and in a party "In a party (3 of 16)";
- a game this machine hosts: "Hosting OpenH1 120 Tick · Slayer on Blood
  Gulch" (what the game says it is: p2p_discord_set_game), and "In the
  lobby" or "Playing" with its players (or the party, in one);
- a game it joined: what it is, and the same.
Its art is the application's: "logo" (every application's; OpenCE's has it
alone), and beside it "party" or "host" in an application of OpenH1's own
(any other than OpenCE's).

Joining (discord.allow_join_requests; neither while off): the activity has
a party (its id and size) and a join secret, which Discord gives only to
the friends the player invites (Discord's Invite to Join) or lets in (a
friend's Ask to Join). The secret is:
- in a party, the party's link (its id is the party's topic's digits, which
  let no one in);
- else in an internet game, its invite, as before (its id is its host's key
  hash);
- else (the menus, a LAN game) the link of a party not made yet, the spare
  (p2p_party_spare), made when a friend is let in, or when one given the
  link arrives (p2p_party_standby listens on its topic meanwhile).
A friend's ask (ACTIVITY_JOIN_REQUEST) is shown in the game
(port/linux/game/network_party.c, p2p_discord_join_request), and answered
(p2p_discord_answer): SEND_ACTIVITY_JOIN_INVITE lets them in,
CLOSE_ACTIVITY_REQUEST does not; one not answered in REQUEST_TIMEOUT is
declined, and so is any while joining is off. The friend's game gets the
secret as ACTIVITY_JOIN and takes it as a link opened (p2p_invite_received):
a party's link joins the party, which takes them on to its leader's lobby or
game (p2p_party.c's following).

It goes through the Discord application in discord.application_id
(config.toml; OpenCE's by default, until OpenH1 has its own: its name is
what Discord shows as being played). Without one, or without Discord
running, invites are still links (p2p.c).

The protocol: frames of a little-endian opcode and length, then JSON. The
handshake (opcode 0) names the application; commands and events are opcode
1; 2 closes; 3 and 4 are ping and pong. Discord takes five activities in
twenty seconds: one is sent each ACTIVITY_INTERVAL at most, the latest.
Nothing here waits for Discord (the p2p thread holds its lock, which the
game's threads take): what it does not take at once waits in a buffer, and
a client that lets that fill up is disconnected.
