/*
XGPU_SPIRV.H

SPIR-V from the shader intermediate form (xgpu_shader.h), for the Vulkan
backend (port/linux/vulkan): xgpu_spirv.c. The programs are OpenCE's GLSL
emitter's, written as SPIR-V words directly rather than as GLSL for a
compiler: the shaders are made from pipeline keys
as the game first draws with them, and a GLSL compiler in the host would
cost a library of megabytes and milliseconds a shader there, where these
programs (no control flow but discarding, a few dozen kinds of operation)
are a walk over the form. spirv-val checks the words
(tools/spirv_corpus).

The conventions (SPIR-V 1.3, Vulkan 1.1):

- clip space is Vulkan's (z 0 to 1, the first row at the top of the
  framebuffer, y down): the game's position (Direct3D's, y up) has its y
  negated, so that the targets' first row is the Xbox's top one;
- vertex attributes are at location n for v<n>. A D3DCOLOR is
  VK_FORMAT_B8G8R8A8_UNORM (read as RGBA); NORMPACKED3
  is VK_FORMAT_R32_UINT, unpacked here; the unnormalized shorts
  (integer_attribute_mask) are VK_FORMAT_R16*_SINT, read as integers and
  converted here; everything else is read as a vec4, the missing components
  0, 0, 0, 1;
- the draw's values are uniform buffers in descriptor set
  XGPU_SPIRV_SET_DRAW: the vertex constants (192 vec4) at
  XGPU_SPIRV_BINDING_CONSTANTS, struct xgpu_spirv_uniforms at
  XGPU_SPIRV_BINDING_UNIFORMS (both stages), the enhanced dynamic lights'
  block and cells (struct xgpu_dynamic_lights_block, a usampler3D) and the
  visibility tests' counters (a storage buffer of uints) at theirs;
- each stage's texture is a combined image sampler at binding n of
  XGPU_SPIRV_SET_TEXTURES; the samplers have D3DTSS_MIPMAPLODBIAS
  (mipLodBias) and the border colors (VK_EXT_custom_border_color), or the
  shader draws the border as the Metal emitter's does
  (xgpu_spirv_options border);
- the stages hand on, at locations XGPU_SPIRV_LOCATION_*: the colors, the
  texture coordinates, fog, and with lighting the world normal, position,
  binormal and tangent (or, lit for each vertex with the ambient occlusion,
  the ambient and the point lights' light);
- the VR mode uses Vulkan multiview, with ViewIndex relative to the
  attachment view's first layer. A draw of one eye uses that eye's layer
  (its two layers when foveated) as the attachment view. The eyes and all
  other targets have their first row at the top: neither the eye positions
  nor layered texture lookups flip rows.

  the shader draws (its sampler clamping to the edge) where the sampler
  cannot (no VK_EXT_custom_border_color): part of the pipeline, as the
  pixel key is;
- multiview: the vertex shader's XGPU_MULTIVIEW_* mode (the pixel
  program carries its own); foveated: four layers, periphery and inset
  for each eye, rather than the two eyes alone;
- the pixel shaders' debugging settings, as the GLSL's;
- effect: the VR mode's effects (XGPU_SPIRV_EFFECT_*, below), and
  effect_fade how their fade is drawn under the pipeline's blend
  (XGPU_SPIRV_FADE_*: the backend's choice); for the glows' shaders, any effect draws them

/* ---------- the VR mode's effects

The game's effects (particles, contrails, weather: its effect shaders),
drawn into both eyes at once (the pixel key's vr_effect: d3d8_device.c,
halo_vr_effect_depth):

- XGPU_SPIRV_EFFECT_SOFT: soft. Each pixel finds the world point it draws
  and the scene's behind it (the depth buffer, texture
  XGPU_SPIRV_EFFECT_DEPTH_BINDING, an array of the views' layers sampled
  with texelFetch; the uniforms' effect_unproject) and fades the effect out
  as the two meet, over a distance scaled to the effect's sprite (its
  radius, the thickness map's green, in the world by the texels' size
  there), so that it meets walls and floors without a hard line.
- XGPU_SPIRV_EFFECT_THICK: soft and thick. The sprite's thickness (the map
  at XGPU_SPIRV_EFFECT_THICKNESS_BINDING, baked from its bitmap's alpha:
  xgpu_vulkan_effects.h) is a bulge toward the eyes: each eye's ray meets
  the bulge's front where the sprite's texel there is drawn (one parallax
  step: the bulge is smooth and the eyes' rays near the sprite's normal),
  so each eye samples other texels and the effect has depth inside it; the
  fade is measured from the bulge's front, through its thickness.

The pixel program must sample texture 0 in 2D (the effect's bitmap) and
not textures 2 and 3, whose bindings the depth and thickness take
(xgpu_spirv_effect_possible), drawn into both eyes. The fade is drawn as
the blend's own nothing (XGPU_SPIRV_FADE_*): alpha to 0 over an alpha
blend, colour to 0 when added, to white when multiplied, to grey when
multiplied twice. */

along that eye's ray: the haze's density falls off from the bolt as the
card's glow does across it (a wide Gaussian, less its value at the glow's
edge, and a narrow hot core), and its integral along the ray is closed
(each Gaussian's is an error function's difference), from the eye to the
scene's surface behind the pixel. Unhidden, a ray passing the bolt at a
fraction r of the glow's size gets exactly the card's glow at r; a wall
through the glow hides the part behind it, in each eye as it should. The
quad drawn covers the haze's outline from the head (a quad about the bolt
facing the head's centre, or, with the head in the haze, one across the
