/*
P2P_FRIENDS.C

Friends (p2p.h): lasting friends of a player profile, with friend codes,
online status and recent players. Like a party (p2p_party.c) they live on
the signalling brokers alone (p2p_signal.c), which learn nothing of them:
every topic is a hash, every message sealed.

- Identity: each player profile has a key of its own, kept in friends.txt in
  the profile's folder (port/linux/game/friends_menu.inc says which): an
  Ed25519 seed, made the first time. Its public key is who the profile is.
- Friend code: the first 55 bits of SHA-256("openh1 friend code" | key), as
  11 characters of Crockford's base32 (0-9 and the letters but I, L, O, U),
  then a check character, in groups of four: "K7QM-2XPA-9DTR". The check is
  Damm's algorithm over the 32 characters (the quasigroup x a + b of
  GF(32)), which catches every mistyped character and every swap of two
  neighbours. Typing is forgiving: lower case, I and L for 1, O for 0, and
  the dashes and spaces anywhere. Finding a key of another's code takes
  some 2^55 tries.
- Inbox: a code's topic, hceu/3/f/<HMAC(code, "inbox")>, which the profile
  listens on. Anyone with a code can write to it, so what comes there is
  checked and counted (MAXIMUM_CHECKS) before it is believed.
- A request ('R', then the message sealed with HMAC(code, "inbox seal")): ADD,
  "let us be friends", with the sender's key and name. It is shown as a
  request; accepting it sends an ADD back. An ADD from the machine whose code
  this profile asked for (a request sent) makes them friends: asking each
  other is accepting. A request sent is sent again at each start and every
  ADD_INTERVAL until answered or cancelled (the other may be offline).
- A friend's message ('F', the 8-byte tag of the pair and sender, then the
  message sealed with the pair's key): each pair's key comes from their
  X25519 secret (the Ed25519 keys' X25519 forms) and both keys. HELLO gives
  the friend this profile's presence key and its generation, and says which
  generation of the friend's it holds; one that holds an old one is sent
  another HELLO. INVITE gives the party's link (a toast, accepted with the
  party's accept key). REMOVE ends the friendship on both sides.
- Presence: each profile's presence topic, hceu/3/f/<HMAC(presence key,
  "presence")>, which only its friends can work out, carries PRESENCE sealed
  with the presence key: where it is (the menus, a party and its size,
  hosting or playing, and what: the game's words as Discord has them), its
  name, and the link that joins it, which is its party's, else its spare party
  (p2p_party_spare: the one Discord's Ask to Join makes; a friend's JOIN
  makes the party, this profile its leader, and the party then follows it
  into its games as any party does). Published when it changes (at most each
  PRESENCE_CHANGE_INTERVAL), every PRESENCE_INTERVAL, and once when a friend
  comes online; a friend not heard for PRESENCE_TIMEOUT is offline. With
  friends.share_status off nothing is published (a last OFFLINE as it is
  turned off), and no HELLO is sent. Removing or blocking a friend makes a
  new presence key (a new generation), which the others get by HELLO: the
  friend removed can no longer read or find the presence.
- Every message (network byte order): "F", the format (FRIENDS_VERSION: a
  machine takes its own alone, and builds without friends never listen),
  its type, the sender's key (32), its time (8: milliseconds since 1970, made
  to increase: a sender's are taken in order, once each), the type's own,
  then an Ed25519 signature over a context (the recipient's code's, or the
  presence key's) and the message.
- Recent players: the OpenH1 players of the games played (the game tells
  their codes: port/linux/game/network_party.c), the last P2P_FRIENDS_RECENT,
  with when and in what game; an OpenCE player or one of no code (an older
  build, a Legacy game) is kept, shown as one who cannot be added.
- Blocking: a blocked code's requests, ADDs and invites are let go.
- friends.txt is the profile's alone and untrusted: read up to
  FILE_MAXIMUM bytes, its lines checked, its text cut to printable ASCII; it
  is written whole, to friends.txt.new first.

Everything runs under p2p_lock: the p2p thread's passes, and the game's
calls (their functions take it).
