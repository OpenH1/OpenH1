/*
REPORT.C

Save Report: a zip of what helps find a problem, saved in reports/ beside
maps/ (reports/<date>_<time>.zip) for the player to send to the developers.
Asked for by controls.report (F8, in a game too: xinput_sdl.c) or Settings >
Profiles > REPORT A PROBLEM (menu_functions.c), both report_request, and
saved at the next frame presented (d3d8_device.c: report_write), whose
picture is its screenshot: the moment the key was pressed. Then a new issue
on OpenH1's GitHub repository opens in the browser, its title and body
filled in with report.md, and (on a computer) the reports folder: the
player says what happened, drags the zip in and submits it. Nothing is
sent by the game itself. Its issue is public, so what could say who the
player is never goes in: settings.txt leaves the private settings out, and
every text in it, and the issue's body, is scrubbed (report_scrub: the
home folder, links, addresses, chat lines, names). Asked for in a game
(report_game_playing), with the key, a note is asked for first; and the
issue waits until the main menu is up (report_game_menus), so that nothing
is opened over the game. A second ask within REPORT_AGAIN_SECONDS of one is
let go (a key pressed twice opens one issue).

The zip holds:
  report.md      a GitHub issue's body, its first lines for the player to
                 fill in (report_issue_url): the build, the platform, the GPU and its driver (the
                 renderer's host's: xgpu_backend_device), the processor, the
                 display's settings, the map and the game, how long the game
                 has run, where the game is (report_where_text: the level, its
                 time and BSP, the player, the network game, the console's
                 lines that look from the camera's place), and the frame times of the last REPORT_SECONDS
                 (report_frame_summary: the frame rate, its 1% and 0.1% lows,
                 the longest frames and when; report_gpu_summary: the GPU's
                 time a frame, how busy the GPU, the game and the renderer's
                 thread were, and what held the frames back)
  log.txt        this run's log (platform_log's lines), its last
                 REPORT_LOG_SIZE bytes, kept here: on Linux and Android the
                 log is not otherwise in a file
  halo.log       the host's log file, where it has one (Windows beside
                 halo.exe, the macOS app's in ~/Library/Logs/OpenH1), its end
  host.log       where it has none (Linux, Android, the macOS executable
                 run by itself): the renderer's host's last lines, which go
                 only to the standard error stream or logcat (its Vulkan
                 device, validation errors, the swapchain's problems), kept
                 by the host (host_log_recent, port/android/host/host_common.c)
  debug.txt      the game's own log, in the data folder
  settings.txt   the settings changed from their defaults (not config.toml:
                 never the passwords, this machine's addresses, keys)
  screenshot.png the frame shown when it was asked for
  crash.txt      a crash's report: what the host wrote of it, with that
                 run's log, or what is known of a run that did not exit

A crash ends the game before F8 can be pressed, so the next start offers to
report it. Each session writes reports/.running as it starts (its build,
when it began, debug.txt's reference address: report_session_start) and
removes it when the game exits (atexit: the window closed, Quit,
debug.exit_after); a crash leaves it. The host, at a crash, writes
reports/.crash.txt: the crash's lines as it logs them (the signal, the
address, the registers, the frames) and then this run's log kept here, the
ring below, which a signal handler can write as it is (host_crash_record,
port/android/host/host_common.c); a fatal error's halt writes it too
(report_session_halted, main.c), and keeps both at the exit that follows.
The next start finds them, keeps them as
reports/.crashed and .crashed.txt until they are answered, and at the main
menu asks once, "OpenH1 closed unexpectedly last time. Report it?"
(pc_menu_crash_question_open, menu_functions.c): REPORT saves a report
headed by the crash (report_crash_summary), with crash.txt in its zip, and
opens its issue; SKIP never asks of that crash again. On Android and iOS,
whose systems end an app in the background without a word, a crash is one
the host wrote; on a computer, a session that did not exit is one (killed,
or a crash the host could not write). A run nobody watches does not ask: it
logs what the report would say, and debug.crash_answer answers for a test.

A frame's time costs a clock reading and six stores (report_frame_presented,
on the render thread, as report_write is); a log line a copy into the ring.
