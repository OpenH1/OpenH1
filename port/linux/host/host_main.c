/*
HOST_MAIN.C

Entry point of the Linux builds that run the game as an ILP32 guest (the
64-bit ARM and x86 builds, tools/linux_guest_build.py).

The host is the Android port's (port/android/host, port/android/README.md),
with this file in place of its host_main.c and host_touch.c; what both
mains do is in host_common.c there. It loads the guest image (the game,
built as ILP32 code) from inside the executable (guest_image.S), and runs
its main() on a thread of its own with its stack in guest memory
(host_thread.c). The main thread waits; the game ends the process.

The guest is the Linux desktop build of the game, so it finds the game data,
the saves and config.toml as port/linux/README.md says: it gets the part of
this process's environment that it reads (the HALO_ settings, HOME, the XDG
folders), and /proc/self/exe is this executable.
The log is the standard error stream.

The macOS build (tools/macos_build.py, port/macos) uses this file too. There
the guest's memory lies at a base the host chooses (HALO_GUEST_BASE), its
system calls are translated to Darwin's (port/macos/host_syscall.c), its
config.toml is in the app's settings folder (port/macos/host_app.m), and
the game runs on the process's main thread, which Cocoa's windows and
events need, after moving it onto a stack in guest memory.

The iOS build (tools/ios_build.py, port/ios) is the macOS one with UIKit's
app around it: main hands the process to UIKit's run loop (SDL_RunApp),
which calls back once the app has launched, and the game then runs on the
main thread as on macOS, its event pumps running UIKit's loop. The app's
folders are port/ios/host_app.m's, and the guest's code is mapped from the
executable (host_loader.c).
