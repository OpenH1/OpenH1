/*
KEYBOARD_WALK.C

The keys' Walk (controls.walk, Left Shift): while it is held (or toggled on,
input.walk), the movement keys push the player only part of the way, as a
controller's stick pushed a little does. A player shows on the enemies'
motion trackers while the square of its velocity (world units a 30 Hz
tick, whatever game.sim_rate is: the sub-steps move a share of a tick's
velocity, bipeds.c) is at least the HUD globals' motion sensor velocity
sensitivity (motion_sensor.c's should_draw_object), and on the ground a
biped's velocity is its throttle times its speed (biped_player_movement):
so a throttle below the threshold's velocity over the fastest the player
can run keeps it off them, in every direction, as a light push of a stick
does. input.walk_speed "tracker" is that throttle; a percentage, that part
of the full push.

It is only a throttle (source/input/input_abstraction.c's
keyboard_controls_apply): the player's movement as a stick's, sent and
played as any controller's, on the 127 steps a network game sends a
throttle in (network_distributed.c, network_substeps.c), which it is
rounded down to, so that no machine sees it faster than this one.
