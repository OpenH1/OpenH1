/*
MENU_ENGINE.C

The port's menu engine (docs/menu_engine.md), under display.menu_engine
"new": the generated screens of the PC menus (port/assets/menus, the widgets
menu_tags.c builds) run from the menus' model (port/assets/menus/model,
halo_menus.h), the in-game pause menu and the Xbox's menus (display.menus
"xbox") still the game's.

A screen is one widget of the game's with no parent, its stand-in, which
ui_widget.c opens, keeps in its history and closes as its own (its hooks:
menu_engine_screen_opened and _closed). What is in it is the engine's: it
lays it out and draws it (menu_engine_screen_draw), each widget with the
game's own drawing (ui_widget_port_render_node: its picture, text, spinner
or list, as ui_widget.c draws them, so the look is the same), and takes its
events (menu_engine_screen_event). The widgets are the game's struct
widget_instance (menu_widget.h), so that the menus' functions
(menu_functions.c), which read and write them by name, run alike on both.

Each widget is drawn from its look in the model (model/look: its box, wide
layout, places, pictures, text and its style, and where its children are),
not its definition: ui_widget.c finds every widget's definition through
menu_engine_definition, which gives it the one menu_tags.c made from the
model (pc_menu_look_definition). From the model the engine also takes what
the widgets cannot say: a settings screen's rows and sections, their order
and the geometry they are laid out by (menu_engine_settings_layout, in place
of settings_rows_pack's packing), each row's help and note
(menu_engine_row_help, in place of the help found by its label's index + 1);
and how each widget takes its events and what they do, its behaviour
(model/behaviour: its flags and its <on> handlers, which menu_tags.c makes
the game's), in place of its definition's.
