/*
NETWORK_WELCOME.C

The host's welcome to OpenCE players (port/linux/NETCODE.md, "OpenH1 and
Legacy games"): two lines of the text chat that say this server runs
OpenH1, and where to get it.

Each line is a notice of the text chat (network_chat.c's
_chat_line_notice_bit in _distributed_message_chat_down), which OpenCE's
own chat shows as it is, from no player, so nothing new goes between the
machines. (OpenCE's client takes no line at all, notices too, in a public
game it joined from the server browser.) A Legacy game is OpenCE's in every
byte, so its host cannot tell an OpenCE machine from an OpenH1 one: it
welcomes every client machine, in any kind of game, and an OpenH1 machine
does not show the lines (network_welcome_line). Only OpenCE players see
them (and OpenH1 builds older than the welcome). An OpenH1 game's host
knows its OpenH1 machines by the token they joined with
(network_standard_machine_is_openh1), and sends them none.

A machine is welcomed once it has loaded the game (its client ready, which
it sends from its first tick: a line sent while it loads is let go as its
game starts), WELCOME_DELAY_MILLISECONDS later, so that its player sees
the lines in the game. Each player is welcomed once while this host runs,
by their machine's real address and hardware id: not again in the next
game, nor joining again. network.opence_welcome turns it off.
