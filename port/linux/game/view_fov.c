/*
VIEW_FOV.C

The view's field of view (display.fov on foot and in a seat seen in first
person, a passenger's; display.vehicle_fov in a seat seen in third person,
a driver's or gunner's), the first-person weapon's (display.viewmodel_fov) and
whether the weapon is drawn (display.viewmodel_visible) and where
(display.viewmodel_offset_x, _y and _z, display.viewmodel_pitch, _yaw and
_roll, and each weapon's own: display.viewmodel_weapon), the local render
view only: the
observer, its transitions and what the network sends keep the game's own
camera. Each angle is horizontal at 16:9 (the vertical
angle is kept, so other shapes of window widen or narrow as the stock view
does), and 0 keeps the stock view. Called from the game's camera
(main.c's set_window_camera_values), its HUD (hud_draw.c) and the passes
that draw the first-person weapon (rasterizer and render sources).
