/*
DYNAMIC_LIGHTS.C

The enhanced dynamic lights (Video Setup > Graphics > Dynamic Lights,
display.dynamic_lights "enhanced"; "classic", the default, is the game's
own). The lights the game attaches to projectiles (plasma bolts, needles,
rockets), muzzle flashes and explosions are drawn by the renderer
(port/linux/src/d3d8_device.c, xgpu_spirv.c, xgpu_msl.c) for each pixel of
the structure and of the models, through the structure's bump maps, with a softer, brighter
falloff in linear light, and the projectiles' lights have a glow drawn about
them. This is the game's side: each frame (lights_preprocess_scene), the
lights it submits to the rasterizer, with what the renderer needs of each
that it does not have (its cone, whether it has a glow, whether the game's
own pass lights the structure with it), go to the renderer.

Where a light is drawn: the game places a light on an object's marker as
the object moves, at each tick (30 a second), and draws the objects between
ticks (port/linux/game/render_interpolation.c), so a bolt's light would step
behind its bolt; object_lights.c places it on the marker as drawn instead,
each frame. A weapon's own lights (its muzzle flash) the game moves to the
first-person weapon for its holder; an effect's light on the weapon (a
firing effect's) stays on the weapon the body holds, so it is moved to the
same marker of the first-person weapon (dynamic_lights_first_person), where
the effect is seen, and from where the first-person weapon (in the VR mode,
the weapon in the hand) is lit.

debug.dynamic_lights_log logs, each frame, where the first projectile's
light is drawn (the smoothness test: a step for each frame, not for each
tick). Only the drawing changes: nothing the game simulates, nothing sent
between machines.

Which lights are drawn (dynamic_lights_rank): a view finds up to
MAXIMUM_RENDERED_LIGHTS lights in the clusters it sees (halo_port_capacity.h:
512 on the desktop builds), but the rasterizer has room for
MAXIMUM_LIGHTS_PER_WINDOW (128) of them, the enhanced dynamic lights' grid
too (XGPU_DYNAMIC_LIGHTS_MAXIMUM), and the game gave them to the first it
found, in the clusters' order. Past 128, the lights are put in the order of
what they show first, so that the 128 drawn are those that matter most to
the view, classic or enhanced.
