/*
FIRST_PERSON_LEGS.C

Your own legs in first person (Video Setup > FOV and Viewmodels > Legs): the
player's own body, which the game animates as everyone else sees it but does
not draw for its own player, drawn from the waist down. Look down while
standing, running, strafing or crouching and the legs move as the body's
animation moves them.

Only the drawing is changed: a copy of the body's pose, all but its hips and
legs folded into a lid over the waist, the whole set back a little behind
the eye so the camera never looks out through the hips. The body itself, its hit boxes and markers, are the game's
as ever. The legs are drawn in the world with the world's camera, so they
keep their place and size at any field of view.

In the VR mode the whole body is drawn but its head and arms (the arms are
the VR mode's own, from its shoulders to the controllers: vr_hands.c), and
where the real body is rather than the game's: the game's eye is where the
head was at the last recentring and the unit faces where the gun aims, but
the head moves about and turns on its own. So the copy of the pose stands
upright and square over its hips (the game's leans into its aim, the chest
turned to the gun while the feet stay planted), its neck under the real
head, turned to the body's heading (vr.c's: the head's, which it follows
only past a turn and slowly; the holsters' and the arms' shoulders' too),
and it is not set back: the chest closes the waist, and looking down shows
the chest, the legs and the feet below the head, as the arms reach from its
shoulders. Its upper body leans back about the hips as far as keeps what
the eyes see of it out of their near plane, and the collar's opening out of
their view (first_person_legs_vr_lean): looking down, the eyes nod forward
over the chest. Its neck is a little behind the real one (the armour's
chest is deeper than a person's).

In the VR mode's seats (vr.vehicle_view = "first_person": vr_seat.c) the
body is drawn too, once the eye is in the seat and the body is seated
(first_person_legs_vr_seated): as the game poses it in the seat (its legs
the seat's), but moved so that the top of its neck is under where the
real one is with the head as it was recentred (below and behind the seat's
eye, or a cabin's: vr_cabin.c), its upper body turned about its hips toward
the real neck (as far as FIRST_PERSON_LEGS_SEAT_TURN_MOST) and leant back
clear of the eyes as on foot, its head folded away and, where the VR mode
draws its own arms (vr_hands.c: the hands alone, or with the weapon), its
arms too. In the
Scorpion's hatch (vr.scorpion_view = "hatch") it stands, its legs hanging
straight down into the turret, turned to the body's heading. The game's
body, what others see, is as ever: nothing of the unit changes.
