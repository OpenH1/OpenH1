/*
MENU_SPARTAN.C

The menus' Spartan, in a view of its own among the menus' widgets: up to
four of them, each a scenery object of ui.map's (the menus' models'
scenery, menu_models.h), the assault rifle's attached to its hand, playing
the standing rifle idle, its armor the change color the player's profile
color gives it. Set dressing: no unit, player, physics or AI.

The engine draws them through its own renderer (render_object_alone, as
the scene draws an object), but not in ui.map's scene: the scene's view
leaves them out (menu_spartan_object, render_objects.c), and each is drawn
in a view of its own (rasterizer_view_begin) when the menus draw the
screen's <spartan> it stands in, in the widgets' order: over the screen's
background and what is drawn before it, under the widgets drawn after. Each
view has its own camera, fixed on that Spartan's place on the stage (the
stage where the first was made, never moved by the scene's camera; each
Spartan a step along it from the one before), looking straight at it, so
that a Spartan at a screen's edge is drawn as one in its middle is, not
seen from the side; its own depth (cleared in its rectangle: nothing of the
scene's, the ring or the sky, can cut it), no fog, and a fixed light
(spartan_lighting) in place of the scene's.

A screen asks for a Spartan each frame it draws one (menu_spartan_place:
where in the menus' 640 by 480, how tall, which color). menu_spartan_frame,
at the start of each frame the menus draw, makes the Spartans asked for in
the frame before, stands each on the stage where its view shows it in its
place, and deletes those no screen asked for (a screen closed). A view's
rectangle is its Spartan's box, grown so that a rifle or an arm reaching
out of it is not cut. Without ui.map's Spartan tags (no
file, or one refused: menu_models.c), nothing is made, and the screens draw
the original pictures (menu_spartan_available).
