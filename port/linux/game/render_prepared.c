/*
RENDER_PREPARED.C

A map's preparation (render_enumerate.c: its first frame drawn, unseen,
through every shader, about a hundred times) recorded the first time it is
made, and played back after, in its place: what the walk gave the renderer
(the front end's journal, port/linux/src/d3d8_device.c: each draw that was
not a repeat, in the state it was drawn in, each window operation a backend
prepares for, each texture loaded, in order, and the geometry's pages
uploaded) is given to it again, without the walk. Every backend is given the
same draws, as it was by the walk: Vulkan and Metal make the same pipelines
and bind the same textures.

A record is kept in z:\prepared (beside the decompressed maps' cache
files), a file for each map (its cache file's checksum and scenario), the
records' form (PREPARED_VERSION, not the build: an update keeps them),
whether the frame draws mirrors and the structure it starts in. No setting
is in its key, nor the backend, the platform or the screen's size: one
record is for every player's. The journal holds the game's state, which the
front end turns into pipelines and targets as the settings and the screen
are now (prepared_settings says of each setting why), and the walk draws,
as it records, what every setting's would (the enhanced lights' passes,
the ambient occlusion's pre-pass and Panini's pass, whatever the settings:
the front end plays back what the settings now want of them). Played back
under the settings, backend and GPU it was made with (its derivation), the
map's enumeration (the set of distinct draws as the front end describes
them: xgpu_manifest_enumeration) must be the record's; under others, which
make other pipelines of the same draws, its objects must all be found. A
record that is missing, cut short, malformed, of another form, whose
objects cannot all be found again, or whose draws are not the record's
under its own derivation, is deleted and the walk made instead, which
records again. A map is recorded at its first load, the stock maps at the game's
first start (menu_pictures_render.c: the menus' pictures' pass loads them
all). HALO_PREPARED_RECORDS=0 turns the records off (the walk every time).

The stock maps' records are shipped with the game too (port/assets/prepared,
made by tools/prepared_records.py: prepared_shipped.h), a file beside the
game holding each compressed, read as it is, never written to z:\prepared. A map's record is looked for in
z:\prepared first, then among the shipped ones; a shipped record that is not
the map's, form's or settings', is malformed, or whose replay does not make
its draws, is passed over for the rest of the game (it cannot be deleted)
and the walk made, which records into z:\prepared as ever. The first start's
pass does not load a map only to record it (record_only) where a record of
it is shipped.

A map prepared again in play (a setting that changes its draws changed:
render_enumerate.c) plays the record it was prepared from (played), whatever
structure it is in now: a record holds every structure's materials, its
objects and effects, so that the one it started in serves them all. A
record that does not play then is left as it is (it played as the map
loaded) and the walk made.

  samples and the pass made as the record plays;
- astc_textures: the textures' upload, as the record loads them;
- dynamic_lights: the walk draws the passes lit by the enhanced lights as it
  records, whatever the setting (halo_dynamic_lights_walked); the draws'
  pipelines lit as the setting is now;
- graphics: a preset, nothing but the other settings' values;
- hdr, hdr_mode: the targets' formats and the tone map, made as the record
  plays; the draws' HDR tags are journaled whatever they are;
- high_res_hud, high_res_text: the bitmaps' pixels, as the record loads them
  (the game draws a bitmap as its tag says either way);
- model_detail: the walk draws each level of each model as the Xbox chose it
  (debug_model_lod: model_detail_rules' stock);
- overshield_effect, shield_glow, viewmodel_shield: a unit's constants and
  lights as it plays; the walk draws every modifier shader on every model;

  (panini.c), played back where it is on now (panini_replay_projection);
- per_pixel_lighting: the model lighting's pipelines, made as the record
  plays;
- shadow_resolution: the shadow maps' size, which the journal does not hold;
- structure_culling: none in the walk (structure_culling.c), the game's own
  visibility's frame;
- first_person_legs, viewmodel_visible: the walk draws every first-person and
