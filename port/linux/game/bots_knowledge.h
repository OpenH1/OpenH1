/* bots_knowledge.h: what a bot knows (port/linux/game/bots_knowledge.c)

A bot knows what a player in its place could: the enemies its own sight
test saw (bots.c's look, and its survey of what is in its view every third
of a second), and with bots.share_sightings its team's, each a callout's
delay (bots.share_delay) after a teammate saw it; the map's item spawns and
their turns by the game's clock, which every player can time; whether an
item lies at its spawn only as the bot itself last saw it there or not, and
that it comes back at the spawn's next turn. bots.c goes and looks where it
knows enemies were, and goes for the items it believes are there or about
to be; it aims and fires only at what its own sight test sees now. Nothing
here is a motion tracker: a bot knows of no enemy it (or its team) did not
see.

Everything is the host's, in the tick that runs the bots, from the game
state at the tick: two runs of the same input know the same. Bot numbers are
bots.h's (0 up, by machine).

Needs cseries.h (real, boolean, TICKS_PER_SECOND) and math/real_math.h
(real_point3d) before it. */
