/*
MENU_TABLE.H

A hand-written screen's live table (docs/menu_screens.md, <table>): its rows
come from a row source of C's, named in the screen's file (source=), which
the screens' registry (port/linux/game/menu_screen.c) gives the table. The
table is the view: its row widgets, the focus among them, their cells drawn;
the source is what is listed: how many rows, which is first on the table
(the rows scroll), which is chosen, and each row's cells. The server
browser's and Select Profile's are menu_functions.c's (pc_menu_browser_source,
pc_menu_profile_source).
