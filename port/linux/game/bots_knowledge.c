/*
BOTS_KNOWLEDGE.C

What a bot knows (bots_knowledge.h): the enemies it saw and its team saw,
and the map's item spawns as it saw them and as the game's clock turns
them.

bots.c tells what its bots see (bots_knowledge_saw, bots_knowledge_saw_item):
an enemy its look found, and each enemy and item spawn in its view that its
sight test reaches, a look every third of a second. A bot remembers the last
sighting of each enemy.

A team's bots share what they see (bots.share_sightings, on by default) as
a callout over the voice chat would: the team keeps the last sighting of
each enemy, and a report of it goes to its other bots, which have it
bots.share_delay after the sighting. While one report is on its way the
next waits, then goes with the last sighting there is, so an enemy kept in
sight is known to the team a delay late, a delay apart. What a bot knows is
its own sightings and the reports that reached it (bots_knowledge_known):
it goes and looks there; its aim is its own sight's alone, never through a
wall. With sharing off a bot knows only what it saw itself.

The items: the map's netgame equipment of this game's type, each with its
period as game_engine_update_item_spawn has it (an item comes back at every
multiple of its period on the game's clock, which a player can time). A bot
believes an item lies at its spawn as it last saw the spawn, there or not,
and that one gone is back at the spawn's next turn.

(The sightings' code came from the ai-bots branch's bots_external.c, whose
orders from outside are not here.)
