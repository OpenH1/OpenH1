/*
SIM_RATE.H

The simulation's two clocks (game.sim_rate; sim_rate.c). The game's time
stays 30 ticks a second, as the maps, the scripts and the network were made
for: everything a tick does runs once a tick, as before. Inside each tick a
fast phase runs 1, 2 or 4 sub-steps (game.sim_rate 30, 60 or 120), where
what a player feels in their hands can later move in smaller steps: their
own movement and aim, projectiles, thrown items, the VR mode's throws and
grabs. The clock spreads a tick's sub-steps over the frames as their time
passes (sim_substep_next, below).

Rules for what moves into the fast phase:

- Per-tick quantities stay per tick in the game state (velocities in world
  units a tick, timers in ticks): the ticks, the network, saved games and
  the scripts read them. A sub-step takes its share with the conversions
  below, each of which is exactly its argument at 30 (and an exact scaling
  by a power of two at 60 and 120, for the linear and quadratic ones).
- Nothing of a sub-step outlives its tick except what a tick at 30 would
  have left in the game state: a game saved (at a tick's end) is the same
  layout at every rate, and a tick at 30 runs exactly as it did.
- A counter of ticks (airborne_ticks, elevator_ticks, a held button's
  ticks: a byte or a short in the game state, which four times the counts
  would overflow) goes on counting ticks: code moved into the fast phase
  counts it on the last sub-step only (sim_substep_is_last).
- Timing that is authored in ticks (rates of fire, animations' frames, the
  AI's and the scripts' timers) stays on the tick.
- No test of the rate itself outside sim_rate.c: the count, the fractions
  and the conversions say all a sub-step needs.
