/*
DEAD_SPECTATE.C

A dead player watching a living teammate until they respawn
(game.spectate_on_death). With "teammates" (the default) a dead player in
co-op (network or split screen) or in a team game sees through a living
teammate's eyes, full screen: the teammate's eye, their aim, their zoom,
and their first-person weapon and arms, their body hidden from that view,
as their own player sees them (not their HUD: no crosshair, meters or
scope's mask; the dead player's own HUD says whom they watch). It is drawn from this machine's copy of the
world, as every other view is: nothing is sent, and nothing the machines of
a network game agree on changes. A free-for-all game has no teammates and
shows nobody's view (the game's own death camera, which orbits the body);
nor does a game with no living teammate.

The view is a camera of the director's (director.c), so the observer, the
frames' interpolation between ticks, the sound's listener and the HUD's
marks follow it as they follow a player's own first-person camera. The
host sends a far player's aim less often than a near one's (the
distributed netcode's priorities), so the aim is eased toward the unit's
over a few frames rather than stepping with each update. A teammate in a
seat whose camera follows the vehicle (a Warthog's driver, a Ghost) is
watched from behind instead, as network co-op's spectating did before
(coop_spectate.c): their own player sees no eyes' view there either.

A press of A (or the keyboard's jump key, which a dead player's input
does nothing else with) goes to the next living teammate; when the one
watched dies the view goes to the next, or with none, to the death camera.
Each local player of split screen has its own choice and its own window.
Respawning, a cutscene (the scripted camera) and the game's end hand the
view back (director.c).

With "off", the game's death camera, and network co-op's view of a
teammate from behind (coop_spectate.c), as before.
