/* The hit sounds (audio.hit_sounds, off by default): a short beep as this
machine's player damages another player, as Halo PC played one. Only damage
that was dealt sounds, as the machine that decides it dealt it: the host's
(and a game of this machine's own) as object_cause_damage deals it
(network_damage_aftermath), a client's as the host's damage of the hit comes
(network_damage_handle_events, the damage events the host sends the machine
of the damage's owner), not as the client shows its own hits at once. So a
hit the host refuses never sounds, nor a player's damage of themselves, nor
of a teammate the gametype's friendly fire spares (it deals nothing), nor of
anything that is not a player's unit (vehicles, the campaign's actors).

The host may forbid them for its players (network.allow_hit_sounds false):
network_standard_hit_sounds_allowed, which an OpenH1 game's record carries
to its clients.

The beep (hit_sound_pcm.inc, made by tools/hit_sound_asset.py: a
PLACEHOLDER) plays through the game's DirectSound buffers
(port/linux/src/dsound_sdl.c), dry, in the front pair, under
audio.effects_volume and audio.volume, at HIT_SOUND_VOLUME. Hits closer
together than HIT_SOUND_SPACING_MILLISECONDS (a shotgun's pellets, an
explosion's players) sound once, and each beep has a buffer of its own, so
that one does not cut the last short. */
