/*
DEMO.C

Demos (docs/demos.md): every game this machine plays, recorded as it plays,
and played again exactly, tick for tick, as the game state was.

The game's simulation is a function of its game state (one block of
memory: game_state.c), the two random seeds the ticks take (random_math.c)
and the players' input of each tick ("Determinism", port/linux/README.md).
A demo is then:

- the state it starts from: a snapshot of the game state and the seeds at
  its first tick (the map's first, a game's first), and one every
  demo.snapshot_seconds after it, for seeking;
- each tick's players' input, as the tick takes it (players.c), every
  player's: this machine's, the bots', and the other machines' that the
  netcode gave it; and each later sub-step's controls of the players' units
  (player_control.c's slot of the fast phase: game.sim_rate's 60 and 120);
- the frames' input that the ticks read: the player control globals (the
  scripts test the players' actions), whole at each tick's start they
  changed by;
- what reached the game state from outside the ticks: at each tick's start,
  and each sub-step's of a tick left open across frames, what differs from
  the state the tick (or sub-step) before left (a player joined or left, a
  host's decision, a console command, an effect a particle made) as the
  bytes that changed; and when the game state was rewritten as a whole (a
  checkpoint reverted to, a saved game loaded, the map started over) or the
  game's code made or deleted an object there, the whole of it. The frames'
  own allocations (the particles, the decals, the lights and the rest
  determinism_compare.py names FRAME_ALLOCATIONS) are not compared: the
  ticks do not read them;
- inside a tick, what a host's netcode put in from its clients (their
  predictions of their units) and the choices it made by which machines are
  there (whose hits are their reports');
- a hash of the game state once a second, and of each allocation, which the
  playback compares with its own, and says where the two first part.

Playing a demo loads its map (a multiplayer game's as a game of this
machine, with its variant), takes its first snapshot, and runs the ticks
with the recorded input in place of the players' (this machine's input,
the bots and the other machines play no part). At each tick's start what
its own frames wrote into the allocations the ticks keep is put back as the
tick before left them, and the recording's differences are written in. Its
sub-steps' controls are put on the units as the recording's were. Nothing
of the machine's own saved games is read or written meanwhile.

The file (demo_files.c writes it on a thread of its own): a header
(DEMO_HEADER_SIZE bytes: the build, the map, the connection, the rate),
then blocks, each packed (zlib): a second of records ('R'), a snapshot that
the playback takes ('K': the start, a reload) or may skip ('k': a seek's).
A record is its type (a byte), its length (4 bytes) and its bytes:

    T <tick> <rate>                    a tick begins (its number as the clock had
                                       it, and the rate it runs at)
    K <tick> <flags> <seeds> {<offset> <size> <bytes>}...
                                       the game state (each allocation's part in
                                       use) and the seeds
    P {<offset> <size> <bytes>}...     what changed in the game state since the
                                       tick before ended
    M <sub-step> {<offset> <size> <bytes>}...
                                       ... before a sub-step of an open tick
    C <offset> <size> <bytes>          the player control globals
    S <global seed> <local seed>       the seeds as they then are
    A {<player> <action>}...           the tick's players' input (players.h's
                                       struct player_action, each in use)
    F {<offset> <size> <bytes>}...     what the netcode put in, inside the tick
    D <choice>                         a choice the netcode made
    U <sub-step> <count> {<player> <unit> <controls>}...
                                       a later sub-step's units' controls
    H <tick> <hash> <hash>...          the game state's hash as the tick ended,
                                       and each allocation's
    V <variant> <options>              the game's variant (a multiplayer game's)
    B <tick> <milliseconds>            a bookmark (the clip key)
    E <tick>                           the end

Everything a demo holds is checked before the playback takes it, as the
netcode checks what another machine sends: a demo is a file anyone may
send. Its snapshots and differences go only into the game state's
allocations, and the game state is checked as a saved game is
(game_state.c) after each; an input is a controller's.

A demo of another build is refused, with the reason: the simulation is
the code, and another's may part from it at the first tick.
