/*
COOP_ENEMIES.C

Network co-op's extra enemies: Server Setup's EXTRA ENEMIES
(network.coop_enemies_mode). PER PLAYER (network.coop_enemies, a
percentage): for each player past the first, each squad of the players'
enemies that a level places (encounters.c's encounter_create) gets that
much of its count more; at 100%, two players meet twice the squad, four
players four times it, but no squad grows past COOP_ENEMIES_MAXIMUM_GROWTH
times its size (at 100%, 64 players made squads 64 times as large: more
than the ground round them, the clients' objects or the host's ticks could
take). STATIC MULTIPLIER (network.coop_enemies_multiplier):
each squad is that many times as large, for any number of players.

Extra enemies are placed in widening rings around the squad's starting
locations, on a spot on the same floor, reachable without passing through
a wall, crate or machine, with room to stand and nobody already there: the
rings, and the room kept between two enemies, as wide as the enemy (a
Hunter's wider than a Grunt's). A starting location with no room left
passes its enemy to the squad's next one. If none has room, the enemy goes
to the nearest of the encounter's firing positions (the places its
designers marked for the AI to stand) near its starting location with
nobody there, and if there is none it is not placed: a squad gets fewer
enemies rather than enemies standing inside one another. The places the
encounter's squads start at are kept free for those placed after. An
enemy that starts in the air (a Sentinel, a Drone) goes on rings at its
height, and a swarm's (Infection forms) there too when the ground has no
room. Each faces a little away from its starting location's facing, by
an amount from its encounter, squad and number: none of this draws on the
game's random seed, so the level's random numbers stay as they were.

A script often places a squad of the next part of a level before its
structure is the one loaded (switch_bsp), when no spot there can be tested:
the extra enemies wait, and are placed as above once it is loaded (those
of a squad with nobody left are forgotten). They were stacked on the
squad's starting locations.

In network co-op with extra enemies, an AI's biped, on the host and on
the clients alike, begins its idle animation (a sleeping Grunt's sleep,
an Elite's watch) at a point of its own whenever it settles into it, so
that a squad and its extra enemies don't breathe and turn in step: the
point comes from the
unit's object index, which a client's copy shares, so every machine has
the same one. Without extra enemies (EXTRA ENEMIES off, or PER PLAYER
with one player) the host's game is the stock one; a client, which isn't
told the setting, varies its copies anyway, which changes only how they
look.

A squad a script loads into a dropship (vehicle_load_magic) can be larger
than the dropship's seats. The riders left without a seat are erased, and
kept: once the dropship's own riders get out (vehicle_unload, or any other
way), they are placed beside those riders, a few ticks apart, and drop and
fight as they do. A dropship gone first takes them with it.

Only the host runs the AI, so all but the idle animations is the host's.
