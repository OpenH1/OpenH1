/*
HUD_KEY_PROMPTS.C

The HUD's button prompts for the keyboard and mouse (input.button_prompts,
"auto" by default): while the first player plays with the keyboard and
mouse, a prompt's controller button ("Hold [X] to pick up", the campaign's
"Press [flashlight]") is drawn as the key or mouse button bound to the
action instead, its name in the prompt's font and colour in a drawn key
cap, as Halo PC named the bound key; while they play with a controller (or
the touch controls) it is the controller's button, as before. An action
with no key bound (Controls Setup's "-") is named Unbound, never the
controller's button, which the player is not holding. The keys are
config.toml's [controls] (Settings > Controls Setup), read as they change,
so a prompt follows a new binding at once (port/linux/src/xinput_sdl.c:
halo_keyboard_prompts, halo_keyboard_action_name).

The game names a prompt's button by a game control (the action, the
flashlight) or by a controller button; a button is the control the
player's profile puts on it (source/input/input_abstraction.c:
input_abstraction_port_keyboard_action). The keyboard's player is the first
local player's; what the keyboard has no action for (the D-pad, the menus'
accept and back) keeps the controller's button. Movement is the four
movement keys ("WASD"), looking the mouse.

In VR (HALO_VR) a prompt names what presses its controller button on
the controllers in the hands instead, as the OpenXR runtime names the
input bound to it, or the gesture that does (port/linux/src/vr.c:
halo_vr_button_name), unless input.button_prompts is "controller".

Only what this machine draws changes: nothing is sent, and nothing the
machines of a network game agree on.
