/*
MATCHMAKING.C

Matchmaking ("find me a Team Slayer game") without a server of OpenH1's
own: the public listings (port/linux/src/p2p_lobby.c) and the signalling
brokers are all it uses. A playlist (matchmaking_playlists: its gametypes,
maps, team size, the most players and the most a party may bring) is
searched by a party's leader, or a player in no party, from the Matchmaking
screen (matchmaking_menu.inc), for the whole party; the members follow their
leader as always (party_menu.inc), and the game's host holds room for them
(network_party.c).

- Looking: the public games are read (p2p_lobby_browse) for
  MATCHMAKING_LOOK_MILLISECONDS, while their hosts' pings are measured, then
  each second the best is picked (matchmaking_pick): an OpenH1 game of this
  build hosted for the playlist (the listing's stamp says which), open, with
  no password, with room for the whole party, not one this machine failed to
  join; of those the lowest ping (in steps of MATCHMAKING_PING_STEP, an
  unknown one taken as MATCHMAKING_UNKNOWN_PING), then the fullest, a lobby
  before a game under way. Nothing about skill is weighed.
- Reaching and joining: the game's invite reached (p2p_join_listing), its
  game joined as the system link list joins one
  (network_game_client_join_available_game), the lobby opened. A host not
  reached, a join refused, is marked failed (p2p_lobby_mark_failed) and the
  search looks again.
- Hosting: when no game fits for MATCHMAKING_SEARCH_MILLISECONDS (and a
  little more, at random, so that two parties searching at once do not both
  host), the party's leader passes the lead to the member that can host best
  (p2p_party_pass_host: a member in the menus whose network is not strict,
  when the leader's is), which then hosts as below and the others follow
  (MATCHMAKING_HANDOFF_MILLISECONDS for it to take the lead, else the leader
  hosts after all); else it hosts itself: an OpenH1 internet game, public,
  listed for the playlist (p2p_set_game_listing_playlist), named after it, of
  its most players, on one of its maps at random with its gametype. Those
  searching find it as above. It starts by itself MATCHMAKING_FULL_MILLISECONDS
  after it is full, or once it has waited MATCHMAKING_FILL_MILLISECONDS: with
  bots filling it (bots_set_matchmaking) in a gametype they play, else with
  the players there are if they are its playlist's least; else it waits on.
  A member asked to host by its leader (p2p_party_take_host_request) hosts
  the same way. A playlist of a tick rate of its own (2V2's) is hosted as an
  OpenH1 game at that rate whatever this machine's network.game_mode and
  network.sim_rate say, closed to OpenCE's players, and, Classic's, with
  every player's view as with display.direct_camera off
  (network_standard_set_hosting_rules); its search takes only games listed
  at that rate. The 2V2 screen's kinds are two such playlists
  (matchmaking_doubles_playlist): Classic at 30, Lowest Latency at 120,
  each only ever matched with its own, by its number and its rate.
- Following: a leader that passed the lead follows its new leader's game as
  a member does, by its invite.
A Legacy game, or one of an older OpenH1, is never picked (the listing says
no playlist), so a search never pulls in a machine of a Legacy game; a game
hosted here takes OpenCE's players as any OpenH1 game does
(network.allow_opence). Everything the search decides is
matchmaking_step's, matchmaking_pick's and matchmaking_start_choice's,
tools/harness/tests/test_matchmaking.py's.
