/*
MENU_ENGINE.H

The port's menu engine (menu_engine.c, docs/menu_engine.md): the generated
screens of the PC menus (port/assets/menus) run from their model, under
display.menu_engine "new". A screen is one widget of the game's, its
stand-in, which ui_widget.c opens, keeps in its history and closes as its
own; the engine lays out, draws and takes the events of what is in it.
These are ui_widget.c's calls into the engine, and the engine's into it.
