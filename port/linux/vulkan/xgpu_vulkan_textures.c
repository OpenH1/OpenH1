/*
XGPU_VULKAN_TEXTURES.C

The Vulkan backend's cache of the Xbox's textures and the high-res
replacements' images (xgpu_vulkan_textures.h), as the Metal backend's
(port/macos/xgpu_metal_textures.c) has them, with the same decoding
(xbox_texture_decode.c, built into the host beside a stand-in for the
platform header: xgpu_vulkan_platform.h).

An Xbox texture is found by its Data, Format and Size words (and a
palettized one's palette, and the channels a Custom Edition map's texels are
sampled from); its texels are read from the guest's memory where they are.
DXT textures are uploaded as they are (BC1 to BC3), where
the device has them, a volume's decoded; where it has not (most Android
phones' GPUs), ASTC where it has that (below), else decoded; every other
format is decoded to BGRA. The pages it was read from are write-protected (the write tracking,
host_memory_watch.c), and the texture is read again once any of them has
been written: the check is a comparison of the tracking's serial while no
page has been, and a look at the texture's pages' generations otherwise. The
host reads a frame after the game drew it: a texture whose memory the game
has let go of since (a map's, as the next loads) is not read (its pages are
no longer the guest's).

An image (a high-res replacement: port/linux/src/xgpu_images.h) is found by
its number and made again when its serial changes; its levels are made from
its first.

debug.texture_dump_directory writes each 2D Xbox texture's first level as it
is read, decoded to BGRA (texture_dump).

A texture no stage has drawn for half a minute of time is let go.

ASTC (HALO_ASTC, the Android app's build; display.astc_textures,
xgpu_astc_chosen: on a device that samples ASTC 4x4 and not BC): a 2D or
cube DXT texture's blocks are transcoded to ASTC 4x4 blocks as it is read
(port/linux/astc/xgpu_astc.h), a quarter of the bytes its decoded texels
were. A texture with blocks transcoding cannot make exactly (DXT3 and DXT5
alpha that varies inside a block, mostly) is drawn decoded while a worker
encodes those (or finds them in memory or on disk: the app's cache folder,
xgpu_vulkan_textures_astc_folder), and made again as ASTC once it has them
(xgpu_vulkan_textures_frame_end), unless the worker finds it better left
decoded. The Metal backend's (port/macos/xgpu_metal_textures.c) does the
same.

The VR mode's effects draw an effect's bitmap with its thickness
(xgpu_vulkan_effects.h), baked from its first level the first time an
effect is drawn with it (as the map is prepared: its enumeration draws
every effect's bitmaps) and kept with it, made again with its texels. A
texture with a thickness is not let go while the guest keeps its texels.
