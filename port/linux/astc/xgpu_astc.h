/*
XGPU_ASTC.H

The Xbox's DXT textures as ASTC 4x4 blocks, for the hosts' renderers on
GPUs that sample ASTC but not BC (iPhones, most Android phones), which
decoded them to 32-bit texels: four times the memory and bandwidth of the
ASTC blocks, eight times DXT1's.

A DXT block is transcoded to the ASTC block that decodes to the same texels
where one exists (xgpu_astc.c, xgpu_astc_transcode): every DXT1 block but
those mixing transparent texels with two or more colors, and DXT3 and DXT5
blocks whose alpha is the same across the block. The rest are encoded from
their decoded texels by ARM's astc-encoder (port/third_party/astc-encoder,
through xgpu_astc_encode.cpp), on worker threads, and the encoded blocks
kept on disk by the hash of the texture's DXT blocks (xgpu_astc_cache.c).
Every block of a texture is independent, so a texture is a list of blocks
here: its levels and faces one after another, as the backend lays them.
