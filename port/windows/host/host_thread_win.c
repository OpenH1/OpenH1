/*
HOST_THREAD_WIN.C

Threads that run guest code, on Windows (host.h's interface: the Linux and
macOS hosts' is port/android/host/host_thread.c).

Guest (x32) code keeps stack addresses in 32-bit registers, so every thread
that runs it needs its stack in guest memory, below 4 GB, which CreateThread
cannot place. Each such thread is created with a small stack of its own and
moves at once onto one in guest memory (host_run_on_stack,
host_enter_win.S), with its stack limits in its TEB moved too, and back
when it is done, before it frees that stack and ends. The game's main
thread is the process's, moved the same way (host_main_win.c).

A low stack is reserved in a pool and committed whole (the guest's code,
built for Linux, does not probe its stack as Windows's growth needs), with
guard pages under it, then a page that is never committed: a stack
overflow is a STATUS_STACK_OVERFLOW (the guard pages) with room left to
report it, then an access violation.

The guest's thread pointer (its musl struct pthread) is kept per thread in
the host's thread-local storage, as on Linux.
