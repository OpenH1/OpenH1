/*
HOST_MAIN_WIN.C

Entry point of the 64-bit Windows build (tools/windows_build.py,
port/windows/README.md "64-bit Windows"): the game as the x32 guest image,
inside this executable (guest_image_win.S), in a 64-bit host.

At the top of main, before anything else is loaded (SDL3.dll is a
delay-loaded DLL; the drivers come with it), the guest's memory below 4 GB
is reserved (host_memory_win.c). If something already holds the fixed
ranges the guest was built for, the game starts again as a launcher would:
a copy of itself, suspended, whose fixed ranges this process reserves
before the copy runs, then waits for it and ends with its exit code.

The game then runs on the process's main thread, moved onto a stack in
guest memory (host_thread_win.c), as the guest's main thread: it makes the
window and pumps its events.

The guest is the desktop build of the game with the Windows code paths
(HALO_WINDOWS), so it finds the game data, the saves and config.toml as the
32-bit Windows build before it did (port/windows/README.md): it gets the part of
this process's environment it reads (its HALO_ settings, the user's
folders), in UTF-8, and /proc/self/exe is this executable. The log is the
standard error stream; without one (a release build has no console),
halo.log beside halo.exe.
