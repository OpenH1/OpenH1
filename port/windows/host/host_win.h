/*
HOST_WIN.H

Internals of the 64-bit Windows host (port/windows/README.md, "64-bit
Windows"): the files of port/windows/host, beside port/android/host's
portable ones (host.h), which it shares with the Linux and macOS hosts.

The guest is the x32 image of the 64-bit x86 Linux build, with the Windows
code paths (tools/windows_build.py). Its memory lies below 4 GB, as on
Linux (it has no base register): the host reserves that address space at
start-up (host_memory_win.c). Its threads run on stacks there
(host_thread_win.c, host_enter_win.S). It calls the host through thunks
from its calling convention (System V's) to Windows's (Microsoft's x64:
tools/android_imports.py --host-abi sysv), and the host calls it through
function pointers of System V's convention (HOST_GUEST_ABI). Its system
calls are Linux's, which host_syscall_win.c performs with Windows's
functions.
